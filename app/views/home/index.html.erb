			<h2> A Thorough Screening Process </h2>
			<p> We've developed a rigorous screening process to make sure our background checks are as accurate as possible. We conduct a full Social Security Number Trace and search for criminal records at the county, state, and federal level. </p> 
			<p> If an individual is a Scout Badge owner, you can trust that he has a clean record according to the law. </p> </div>

					<h2>Share It Anywhere </h2>
			<p>It's easy for you to share your approved Scout Badge anywhere, anytime. Share it on your listing, profile, or resume. </p>
			<p> If a business supports Scout Integration, it's fast and secure for you to incorporate your Scout credentials. This bolsters your reputation and helps you attract more customers.</p> </div>

				<h2> Security is Our Priority </h2>
				<p> Background checks deal with sensitive information. We work hard to ensure our security system is bullet-proof. Once you share your personal information with us, we make sure it never gets out. After you receive your badge, nobody else is able to use it. </p> </div>
